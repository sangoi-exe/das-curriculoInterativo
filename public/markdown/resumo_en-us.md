**Professional Summary**

Although I am an architect by degree, my true natural talent has always been intrinsically tied to computers. While I lack formal experience in Information Technology, I have amassed significant experience in Architecture. Over the course of more than 7 years, I engaged almost daily with clients, other professionals, and public agencies, skills that can be readily leveraged in any IT environment.

My first encounter with a computer was over 30 years ago, and, for at least the past 20 years, I have devoted much of my time to the refinement, albeit indirect, of my computing skills. This journey has ranged from the development of small and unassuming websites, to more complex programming for the automation of repetitive tasks in games, such as the acclaimed bots. With this valuable wealth of knowledge, and with my customary ease in the field, I have experienced exponential growth in assimilating various programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Java, and PHP, as can be evidenced in this interactive resume.

Furthermore, I have developed skills in a variety of frameworks and libraries, including React, Vue.js, Node.js, Angular, Spring Boot, and also in CSS pre-processors such as Sass, SCSS, and Less. I have also specialized in working with relational databases, particularly MySQL, and in handling RESTful APIs with CRUD operations.
