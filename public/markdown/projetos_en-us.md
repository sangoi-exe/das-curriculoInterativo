**Developed Projects**

1. [ChatGPT Extension:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-gptInfoTool)
    - Developed a Chrome browser extension in collaboration with a Tampermonkey script aimed at monitoring the message limit for OpenAI's ChatGPT 4. The monitoring process is executed by locally intercepting the fetch and response functions of ChatGPT's web interface. The browser's fetch function is overridden by a script in Tampermonkey, allowing for the collection of fetch and response data before returning them to their normal flow. For users of ChatGPT 4's Plus plan, which has a limit of 50 messages every three hours, the extension logs and tracks the time and number of messages sent. Additionally, OpenAI's tokenizer was adapted for the extension, enabling the calculation of tokens for sent messages and the total tokens for the conversation.

2. [Interactive Resume:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-portfolio)
    - Developed a website simulating a 90s computer environment, starting with a period-accurate bootscreen that tests an incredible 16 MB of RAM, followed by IDE device detection. The site loads an MS-DOS-like system and offers a responsive interface where you can type commands into an input field to access both resume and simulated system information.

3. [Instagram Follower Checker Extension:](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seguid%C3%B4metro-quem-me-segu/omgdljfkdkebckblcgjbndghgnndjjag)
    - Developed a Chrome extension that allows users to check if the people they are following are following them back, directly from the browser. This enhances user experience and convenience in managing followers on Instagram.

4. [Extension to Enhance Mercado Livre User Experience:](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lnimnppjmnagicphkdbplipabjcikkgl)
    - Developed a Chrome extension that provides detailed and relevant information directly on the search page, enhancing user convenience and shopping experience.¶

5. [Scandiweb Technical Challenge:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-scandiweb)
    - Developed an interface for listing and adding products, utilizing Vue.js for the front-end, PHP OOP for the back-end, and REST API for communication between the two. This challenge is hosted online and available for testing; the content and link are on my GitHub.

6. [Shopper Technical Challenge:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/shopper-desafio)
    - Developed a platform for managing and updating product prices via CSV files, using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, with the implementation of business rules and error handling.

7. [Script Python para Tratamento Vídeos:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-splitOrJoin)
    - Desenvolvimento de um script em Python que permite dividir um vídeo em várias partes menores e, posteriormente, reunir essas partes. O desenvolvimento deste script teve como principal motivação facilitar o uso do Topaz Video AI, uma ferramenta robusta de melhoria da qualidade de vídeos, que, entretanto, não possibilita pausar e retomar uma tarefa. Ao segmentar o vídeo em partes menores, cada segmento pode ser aprimorado individualmente. Depois que todas as partes são aprimoradas, elas podem ser unidas novamente.

8. [Python Script for Data Augmentation and Image Conversion:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/das-dataAugmentation)
    - Developed a Python script that creates modified copies of images from a specified directory. The copies feature subtle changes like rotation, contrast, brightness, colors, etc., enriching the dataset for training image models on a particular object or person. Additionally, the script performs image conversion to PNG format.¶

9. [E-commerce Store in Angular:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/nariga-store)
    - Developed an online store with a user-friendly layout, featuring search functionality, shopping cart, and responsive design.

10. [CRUD System in MySQL:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/angular-php-api)
    - Developed and implemented a form in Angular, using HTML and PHP to display, add, delete, and edit information in a MySQL database.

11. [HideJobIn Browser Extension:](https://github.com/DevArqSangoi/hidejobin-extension)
    - Developed a browser extension that hides job vacancies during LinkedIn searches, improving user experience and privacy. Available on the Chrome Store and linked in my LinkedIn profile.
