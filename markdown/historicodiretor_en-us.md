**Computer History – Director's Cut**

My first encounter with the world of computers occurred at the age of 3, at a Banco Real workstation equipped with a CRT monitor and a text-based user interface. The dark background screen with green letters immediately captivated me, an elegance I have never forgotten.

During a visit to a cousin's house, I used a computer with the Windows 3.1 operating system and the Paint application for the first time. Later, at the age of 6, I attended computer classes at school, which preceded the acquisition of the first family computer in Christmas of 1996. Although opportunities for use were limited by age, this marked the beginning of a long journey of exploration and learning.

As time went on, I expanded my skills to include web development and interaction with various online platforms. I used hosting platforms like GeoCities, Yahoo, HPG, Bol, and AOL to create websites. For editing and design, I employed software like HomeSite for HTML coding, Dreamweaver for layout, Fireworks for image editing, and Flash for interactive elements. This initial exposure to web development provided a deep understanding of HTML code, and laid a solid foundation that would prove to be of great value in the future.¶

My digital journey was also marked by the transition through various internet platforms and social networks since the advent of the internet in Brazil. Initially, internet access was done through the Zaz ISP (Internet Service Provider), using a dial-up connection. For communication, ICQ and Terra/UOL chat were the first options, followed by mIRC, MSN, and Skype. As for social networks, exploration began with Orkut and advanced to more recent platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It's worth mentioning that I was a pioneer in creating a Gmail account, as an invitation was still required for access at that time.

In my adolescence, specifically at the age of 15, I faced the challenge of fixing a cousin's computer. I started without comprehensive knowledge, especially when it came to the importance of drivers. However, my curiosity and eagerness to learn kept me motivated. Over time, I developed more sophisticated skills, allowing me to assist my friends in choosing components and assembling their own computers.

From the beginning, my inclination has been towards the automation of tedious and repetitive tasks. This trend culminated in my most notable experience with the game Ragnarok Online. Even with a very basic initial knowledge of programming, I endeavored to learn Perl. The result was automation that not only completed the game's tutorial but also generated income in two ways: initially through the sale of virtual items in the game and later by converting this virtual currency into real money. This strategy was so successful that Gravity, the company behind the game, had to release a patch to prevent abuse.¶

Due to early encouragement from my parents, I delved into the world of computing through a specialized course in hardware assembly and maintenance. Although I provided services to some clients, this phase was short-lived due to the limitations of the local market at the time. Later, during my school years, I sought to enroll in a technical course in computer science. Unfortunately, even after consultations with school administration and efforts to mitigate the situation, legal age barriers prevailed.

In 2009, my path in computing took a detour. I took the entrance exam for Computer Engineering, where I ended up as an alternate, and the National High School Exam (ENEM). Through ENEM, I chose to study Architecture and Urban Planning, another field of interest. My academic experience was further enriched with a unique opportunity through the Federal Government's 'Science Without Borders' program. In 2014, I participated in an exchange at the University of Pécs in Hungary. After graduation, my career as an architect continued until the end of 2022. However, my interest in computing remained latent throughout this period.

Subsequently, in 2019 and 2021, there were two attempts to transition to the IT field. In the first opportunity, I was admitted to the Computer Networks course at UFSM (Federal University of Santa Maria) through the 'degree holder' modality. In the second, I was admitted to the 'Information Systems' course at the same university, also as a 'degree holder.' However, due to commitments at the time, it was not possible to proceed with the change. After discussions and with the support of my family, I made the decision to change careers, officially entering the IT field.
